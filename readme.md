This website is called Antonio's Cafe, a food and fine dinning restaurant.  
 I use CSS flex box to control the navigation items and logo in the header banner as well as control  
 and organize the content and images in the about, menu and contact sections of the web page.

I use CSS positioning properties to position the Chef, Food Cart and waiter svg images on the header banner.
I use the CSS calc medthod to change the position of the hamburger icon and waiter svg based on viewport width size in mobile.

Media queries are used to control the layout and content for large, medium and mobile sizes.
When the hamburger icon is displayed and clicked on in mobile view I use java script as well as CSS to display on and off the nav items as well as the waiter svg image icon.

I use a java script Multidimensional Array to populate the food menu section of the web page.
I use java script to calculate and populate the store offer on the food menu section of the web page.
I use java script to control an automatic continuous image slide show for the main and menu pictures.
I use java script to style two of the contact form input fields name and date turning them lightgrey.
I use Java script to reload the web page every hour to update the store offer.
